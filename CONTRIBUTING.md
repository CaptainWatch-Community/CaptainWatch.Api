## Branch Naming Convention

To maintain an organized and readable codebase, we have specific naming conventions for branches. Please follow these guidelines when creating a new branch:

1. **Feature Branches**: For new features and enhancements.
    - Format: `feature/name-of-feature`
2. **Bugfix Branches**: For fixing bugs and issues.
    - Format: `bugfix/name-of-bugfix`
3. **Refactoring Branches**: For code refactoring without changing functionality.
    - Format: `refactor/description-of-refactoring`
4. **Documentation Branches**: Specifically for updating or adding documentation.
    - Format: `docs/update-description`

Use hyphens (`-`) to separate words in the branch name. This makes the branch names easier to read and understand at a glance.

By following these naming conventions, you help keep our repository organized and our development process efficient. Thank you for adhering to our standards!

## Commit Message Guidelines

Adhering to a consistent commit message format enhances our project's readability and makes it easier to track changes. We follow the Conventional Commits specification. Here‚Äôs a quick guide to our commit message structure:

1. **Types**: Begin your commit message with a type that reflects the nature of your change. Common types include:
    - `feat` (new feature)
    - `fix` (bug fix)
    - `docs` (changes to documentation)
    - `style` (formatting, missing semicolons, etc; no code change)
    - `refactor` (refactoring production code)
    - `test` (adding tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
    - `chore` (updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc; no production code change)
2. **Scope (Optional)**: Include a scope to indicate the part of the codebase your changes affect. For example, `(auth)` for authentication-related changes.
3. **Description**: Add a succinct description of the change:
    - Use the imperative, present tense: ‚Äúchange‚Äù, not ‚Äúchanged‚Äù nor ‚Äúchanges‚Äù.
    - Don‚Äôt capitalize the first letter.
    - No dot (`.`) at the end.
4. **Body (Optional)**: Provide a more detailed description of the change.
5. **Footer (Optional)**: Mention any related issues and breaking changes.

### Example Commit Messages:

- `feat: add remember me functionality`
- `fix(server): resolve memory leak in file processing`
- `docs(readme): update installation section`
